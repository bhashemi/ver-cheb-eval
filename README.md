Verified evaluation of finite Chebyshev expansions
This repository contains MATLAB/INTLAB implementation of ten different algorithms for computing narrow enclosures for finite Chebyshev expansions. While some of the algorithms are already known, the mathematics behind new algorithms is described in an accompanying preprient. 

The problem of computing enclosures for Chebyshev exapnsions arises in the context of ultra arithmetic, Chebyshev models, computer-assisted proofs of spherical t-designs, and automatic a posteriori forward error analysis of floating point algorithms for evaluation of Chebyshev expansions like the one in Chebfun/feval. 

Requirements

Beyond MATLAB, INTLAB is needed to run the codes in this repository. INTLAB is a MATLAB toolbox for verified computations developed by Rump \cite{INTLAB}. To run the examples you also need Chebfun, a MATLAB package for numerical computing with functions developed at the University of Oxford.
